# Graph-based Recommender System with an E-commerce Web App using Python Flask

This repository contains an e-commerce web application built with Python Flask following the MVC pattern, integrated with a graph-based recommender system implemented using the PinSage model. This project is my graduate dissertation, demonstrating the effectiveness of the PinSage model in generating similar product recommendations.

## Introduction

This web application serves as an e-commerce platform that provides personalized product recommendations using the PinSage model. The PinSage model, developed by researchers at Stanford and Alibaba, is a graph convolutional network (GCN) designed for web-scale recommender systems. The implementation used in this project is based on the [DGL example](https://github.com/dmlc/dgl/tree/master/examples/pytorch/pinsage).

## Features

- **User-friendly Web Interface**: Built with Bootstrap to provide a frendly UI.
- **MVC Pattern**: Structured codebase following the Model-View-Controller pattern.
- **Graph-based Recommendations**: Uses PinSage to generate recommendations for similar products.

## Getting Started

To set up and run this application locally, follow these steps:

**Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pinsage-ecommerce.git
